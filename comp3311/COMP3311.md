## Data Modelling

Data modelling is a design process which converts requirements into a data model.

The aims of data modelling are to:

- describe what _information_ is contained in the database
- describe _relationships_ between data items
- describe _constraints_ on data

## Entity-Relationship Data Modelling (ER Model)

The world is viewed as a collection of inter-related entities.

ER has three major modelling constructs:

1. Attribute: data item describing a property of interest
2. Entity: collection of attributes describing object of interest
3. Relationship: association between entities (objects)

### ER Diagrams

ER diagrams are a graphical tool for data modelling.

An ER diagram consists of:

- a collection of entity set definitions
- a collection of relationship set definitions
- attributes associated with entity and relationship sets
- connections between entity and relationship sets

Key = set of attributes that uniquely identifies each entity instance

ER design elements:

#### Entities

An entity can be viewed as either a set of entities with the same set of attributes or an abstract description of a class of entities.

#### Relationship Sets

A relationship is an association among several entities. A relationship set is a collection of relationships of the same type.

Relationships contain

- **Degree**: the number of entities involved in the relationship
- **Cardinality**: the number of associated entities
  - one-to-one (`[entity]<--(rel)-->[entity]`)
  - one-to-many (`[entity]<--(rel)---[entity]`)
  - many-to-many (`[entity]---(rel)---[entity]`)
- **Participation**: whether every entity must be in the relationship
  - total participation (thick line)
  - partial participation (thin line)

![er-model](./er1.png)

#### Class Hierarchies

ER also implements super-class / sub-class hierarchies

- both super- and sub-classes consist of entities
- super-class has common properties of all entities in hierarchy
- sub-classes can add extra properties to specialise
- entities in super-class may have corresponding entities in sub-class
- sub-classes can be
  - _disjoint_ (entities are members of only one sub-class)
  - _overlapping_ (entities are members of several sub-classes)

## Relational Model

A relational model contains

- Tuples are collections of values
- Relations are set of tuples
- Constraints are logical statements on valid data

Tuples correspond to entities whilst relations correspond to entity sets and relationships.

### Constraints

There are different types of constraints

- unique = value of attribute is unique in relation
- key = chosen unique attribute to distinguish tuples
- domain = type of attribute, restrictions within type
- referential integrity = foreign key
  - tuple in relation R has attribute F
  - whose value corresponds to key attribute K in relation S

## Relational DMBSs

A _relational database management system_ (RDBMS)

### Managing Databases

```bash
# Create a new, empty database
$ createdb dbname

# Drop and remove all data from a database
$ dropdb dbname

# Dump the contents of a database
$ pg_dump dbname > dumpfile

# Restore the contents of a database dump
$ psql dbname -f dumpfile
```

### SQL

SQL is a Data Definition Language that can formalise relational schemas.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableName (
  attrName1 domain1 constraints1,
  attrName2 domain2 constraints2,
  ...
  PRIMARY KEY (attri, attrj,...)
  FOREIGN KEY (attrx, attry,...)
              REFERENCES
              OtherTable (attrm, attrn,...)
);
```

#### Syntax

```sql
-- Comments are after two dashes

-- Identifiers are alphanumeric and can be inside double quotes
-- Identifiers are case insensitive
"An Identifier", AnIdentifier

-- There are many keywords
CREATE, SELECT, TABLE, WHERE

-- Strings are inside single quotes
'a string'

-- Numbers are similar to C
1, -5, 3.14159

-- There are multiple types
integer, float, char(n), varchar(n), date

-- There are multiple operators
=, <>, <, <=, >, >=, AND, OR, NOT
```

#### Managing Tables

```sql
-- Create a table with attributes and constraints
CREATE TABLE table (Attributes + Constraints)

-- Modify a table
ALTER TABLE table TableSchemaChanges

-- Drop a table
DROP TABLE table(s) [ CASCADE ]

-- Truncate a table
TRUNCATE TABLE table(s) [ CASCADE ]
```

#### Managing Tuples

```sql
-- Insert into a table
INSERT INTO table (Attrs) Values Tuple(s)

-- Delete from a table
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition

-- Update a table
UPDATE table SET AttrValueChanges WHERE condition
```

where

- `Attrs` = `(attr1, attr2, ..., attrn)`
- `Tuple` = `(val1, val2, ..., valn)`
- `AttrValueChanges` is a comma separated list of `attrname = expression`

#### Types

```sql
-- Define own constrained type
CREATE DOMAIN Name AS Type CHECK (Constraint)

-- Define tuple type
CREATE TYPE Name AS (AttrName AttrType, ...)

-- Define enumerated type
CREATE TYPE Name AS ENUM ('Label', ...)
```

#### String Comparison

- `a < b` compares strings `a` and `b` using dictionary order
- `a LIKE pattern` matches string `a` to pattern
- `%` matches anything
- `_` matches a single char

PostgreSQL provides regexp-based pattern matching.

```sql
-- ~ and !
Attr ~ 'RegExp'     -- Matches 'RegExp'
Attr !~ 'RegExp'    -- Doesn't match 'RegExp'

-- ~* and !~*
Attr ~* 'RegExp'    -- Matches 'RegExp' case-insensitive
Attr !~* 'RegExp'   -- Doesn't match 'RegExp' case-insensitive
```

#### String Manipulation

```sql
-- Concatenate a and b
a || b

-- Lowercase a
lower(a)

-- Extract substring from a
substring(a, start, count)
```

#### Queries

An SQL query consists of a sequence of clauses:

```sql
SELECT   projectionList
FROM     relations/joins
WHERE    condition
GROUP BY groupingAttributes
HAVING   groupCondition
```

The `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are optional.

#### Views

A view associates a name with a query. Each time the view is invoked (in a `FROM` clause) the query is evaluated, yielding a set of tuples. The set of tuples is used as the value of the view.

A view can be treated as a 'virtual table' and are useful for packaging a complex query to use in other queries.

```sql
CREATE VIEW viewName [(attributes)] AS Query
```

## Programming With SQL

### PostgreSQL Stored Procedures

The PostgreSQL syntax for defining stored _functions_:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  funcName(arg1, arg2, ...) RETURNS retType
AS $$
String containing function definition
$$ LANGUAGE funcDefLanguage;
```

where

- `arg1, arg2, ...` consists of `name type`
- `$$ ... $$` are just a type of string quote
- `LANGUAGE` is a function definition language (e.g. Python, SQL, PLpgSQL)

#### Function Return Types

A PostgreSQL function can return a value which is

- `void`
- An atomic data type (`integer`, `text`, ...)
- A tuple
- A set of atomic values (`setof integer`, ...)
- A set of tuples (`setof Employee` where `Employee` is a tuple)

A function returning a set of values is similar to a view.

### SQL Functions

PostgreSQL allows functions to be defined in SQL:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE
  funcName(arg1type, arg2type, ...)
  RETURNS retType
AS $$
  SQL statements
$$ LANGUAGE sql;
```

Within the function, arguments are accessed as `$1, $2, ...` corresponding to their position in the function definition.

A parameterless function behaves similar to a view.

### PLpgSQL

PLpgSQL stands for **P**rocedural **L**anguage extensions to **P**ost**g**re**SQL**. It is a PostgreSQL-specific language integrating features of procedural programming and SQL programming.

It provides a means for extending DBMS functionality, specifically it

- Implements constraint checking (triggered functions)
- Has complex query evaluation (e.g. recursive)
- Has complex computation of column values
- Has detailed control of displayed results

PLpgSQL functions are created (and inserted into db) via:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE
  funcName(param1, param2, ...)
  RETURNS retType
AS $$
DECLARE
   variable declarations
BEGIN
   code for function
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

The entire function body is stored as a single SQL string.

#### Syntax

```sql
-- Assignment
var := exp
SELECT exp INTO var

-- Selection
IF C1 THEN S1
ELSIF C2 THEN S2 ...
ELSE S END IF

-- Iteration
LOOP S END LOOP
WHILE C LOOP S END LOOP
FOR rec_var IN Query LOOP ...
FOR int_var IN lo..hi LOOP ...
```

##### `SELECT ... INTO`

Can capture query results via

```sql
SELECT Exp1, Exp2, ..., ExpN
INTO   Var1, Var2, ..., VarN
FROM   TableList
WHERE  Condition ...
```

where the query is executed as usual, a projection list is returned as usual and each `ExpI` is assigned corresponding to each `VarI`.

### Aggregates

Aggregates reduce a collection of values into a single result.

The action of an aggregate function can be viewed as

```c
State = initial state for each item V {
  // update State to include V
  State = updateState(State, V)
}
return makeFinal(State)
```

#### PostgreSQL User Defined Aggregates

The SQL standard does not specify user-defined aggregates, but PostgreSQL does provides a mechanism for defining them.

To define a new aggregate, we need to supply

- A `BaseType`, the type of input values
- A `StateType`, the type of intermediate states
- A state mapping function `sfunc(state, value) -> newState`
- Optionally, an initial state value (defaults to `NULL`)
- Optionally, a final function `ffunc(state) -> result`

Aggregates are created using the `CREATE AGGREGATE` statement:

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE AggName(BaseType) (
  sfunc = UpdateStateFunction,
  stype = StateType,
  initcond = InitialValue,
  finalfunc = MakeFinalFunction,
  sortop = OrderingOperator
);
```

where

- `initcond` (with type `StateType`) is optional; defaults to `NULL`
- `finalfunc` is optional; defaults to identity function
- `sortop` is optional; needed for min/max-type aggregates

##### User Defined `count()`

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE myCount(anyelement) (
  stype = int,
  initcond = 0,
  sfunc = oneMore
);

CREATE FUNCTION oneMore(sum int, x anyelement) RETURNS int
AS $$
  BEGIN
    RETURN sum + 1;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;
```

### Constraints

Column and table constraints ensure validity of one table. Global constraints may involve conditions over many tables.

#### Assertions

SQL implementation of global constraints is `ASSERTION`

- Example: #students in any UNSW course must be < 10000

```sql
create assertion ClassSizeConstraint check (
   not exists (
      select c.id
      from   Courses c
             join Enrolments e on (c.id = e.course)
      group  by c.id
      having count(e.student) > 9999
   )
);
```

This is too expensive, so DBMSs provide _triggers_ to do targetted checking.

#### Triggers

Triggers are procedures stored in the database that are activated in response to database events.

Triggers provide event-condition-action (ECA) programming where

- An _event_ activates the trigger
- A _condition_ is checked
- If the condition holds, an _action_ is executed

To define a trigger, we use the syntax

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER TriggerName
{AFTER|BEFORE} Event1 [ OR Event2 ... ]
[ FOR EACH ROW ]
ON TableName
[ WHEN ( Condition ) ]
Block of Procedural/SQL Code;
```

Possible `Event`s are `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`.

##### Semantics

Triggers can be activated `BEFORE` or `AFTER` the event.

If activated `BEFORE`

- A value `NEW` contains the "proposed" value of changed tuple
- Modifying `NEW` causes a different value to be placed in the database

If activated `AFTER`

- `NEW` contains the current value of the changed tuple
- A value `OLD` contains the previous value of the changed tuple
- Constraint checking _has_ been done for `NEW`

## Programming With Databases

A common database access pattern used in programming languages is seen below.

```python
db = connect_to_dbms(DBname, User/Password)

query = build_SQL('SQLStatementTemplate', values)

results = execute_query(db, query)

while more_tuples_in(results):
  tuple = fetch_row_from(results)
  # do something with values in tuple
```

### Python & Psycopg2

Psycopg2 is a Python module that provides

- A method to connect to PostgreSQL databases
- A collection of DB-related exceptions
- A collection of type and object constructors

A standard Psycopg2 program is seen below.

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(DB_connection_string)

cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('SQLStatementTemplate', values)

conn.close()
```

Psycopg2 has various useful methods

- `conn.commit()`
  - Commit changes made to the database since last `commit()`
- `cur.mogrify('SQLStatementTemplate', values)`
  - Returns the SQL statement as a string with values inserted
- `cur.fetchall()`
  - Returns a list of tuples
- `cur.fetchone()`
  - Returns a single tuple
- `cur.fetchmany(nTuples)`
  - Returns `nTuples` amount of tuples
