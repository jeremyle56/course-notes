\subsection{Fields}

\defn{Field}{
    A field \(K\) is a commutative ring with identity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
}

\prop{No Divisors of Zero in Fields}{
    A field contains no divisors of zero.
}

\prop{All fields are Integral Domains}{
    A field is an integral domain.
}

\thrm{Inverse and GCD}{
    An element \(n \in \bZ_m^*\) has an inverse if and only if \(\gcd(m , n) = 1\).
}

\thrm{Rings and Fields}{
    The ring \(Z_m\) is a field if and only if \(m\) is prime.
}

\subsection{Units of a Ring}
\paragraph{Notation for Set of Units} In \(\bZ_m\), we denote the set of units by \(\bU_m\).
