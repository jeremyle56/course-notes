\subsection*{Question 1}
\textbf{Problem.} Prove that $\log_{18} 12$ is irrational.
\newline
\textbf{Proof} by contradiction. Suppose that $\log_{18} 12$ is not irrational. Then we can write

\begin{equation*}
\log_{18} 12 = \frac{m}{n}
\end{equation*}
where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers (as $\log_{18} 12 > 0$) with no common factors. Rearranging the equation leads to 
\begin{equation*}
18^m = 12^n.
\end{equation*}
Finding the respective prime factorisation,
\begin{equation*}
    2^m 3^{2m} = 2^{2n} 3^n,
\end{equation*}
and simplifying gives
\begin{equation*}
    2^{m-2n} = 3^{n-2m}.
\end{equation*}
But $2$ and $3$ are different primes, as such no power of $2$ can equal a power of $3$ besides the solution $m = n = 0$ which is a contradiction. Therefore, our original assumption (that $\log_{18} 12$ is not irrational) must be false; that is, $log_{18} 12$ is irrational.
