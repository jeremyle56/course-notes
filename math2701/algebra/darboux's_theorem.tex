\subsection{Darboux's Theorem}

\begin{lemma}
    Let \(t > 0, t \neq 1\), and \(P, Q\) be points on \(\ell(A, B)\) such that \(\frac{AP}{PB} = t, \frac{AQ}{QB} = -t\). Then \(C\) is the midpoint of \(P, Q\) if and only if \(\frac{AC}{CB} = -t^2\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
    If \(\alpha\) is a collineation, and point \(P\) is between points \(A, B\) then \(\alpha(P)\) is between \(\alpha(A), \alpha(B)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    A collineation on \(\bR^n\) fixing two points on a line fixes the line pointwise.
\end{corollary}
