\subsection{The Real Projective Line \(\bR P^1\), Plane \(\bR P^2\) and Space \(\bR P^n\)}

\begin{definition}
    \begin{statements}{}
        \item The real projective plane \(\bR P^2\) is defined as the extended Euclidean plane
        \[\bR P^2 := \bR^2 \sqcup \bR P^1\]
        The points in \(bR^2\) (resp., \(\bR P^1\)) are called \textbf{ordinary} (resp., \textbf{ideal}) points and \(\ell_\infty := \bR P^1\) is called the \textbf{ideal (projective) line}.
        \item In general, for \(n \geq 3\), define the \textbf{\(n\)-dimensional real projective space}
        \[\bR P^n = \underbrace{\bR^2}_{\text{ordinary points}} \bigsqcup \underbrace{\bR P^{n- 1}}_{\text{ideal points}}\]
        as a disjoint union of the \textbf{ordinary} part \(\bR^n\) and the \textbf{ideal} part \(\bR P^{n-1}\)
    \end{statements}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Two distinct \textbf{projective lines} have \textbf{exactly one} point of intersection.
