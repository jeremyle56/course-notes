\section{Differentiability}

\paragraph{Definition}
Suppose that \(S \subseteq \bC\) and that \(f: S \to \bC\) is a complex function. Then we say that \(f\) is differentiable at the point \(z_0\) in \(S\) if
\[\lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0}, \qquad \text{or equivalently} \qquad \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h},\]
exists. If it exists, it is called the derivative of \(f\) at \(z_0\), and written \(f'(z_0)\) or \(\dfrac{df(z_0)}{dz}\).
