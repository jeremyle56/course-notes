\section{Error Detection and Correction Codes}

\subsection{ISBN-10 Error Capability}
ISBN-10 numbers are capable of detecting the two types of errors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item getting a digit wrong
    \item interchanging two (unequal) digits.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Binary Repetition Codes}
The binary \((2t + 1)\)-repetition code is \(t\)-error correcting.

The binary \(2t\)-repetition code is \((t- 1)\)-error correcting and \(t\)-error detecting.
