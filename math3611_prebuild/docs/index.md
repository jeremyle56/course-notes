# MATH3611 Higher Analysis

This website servers as a platform to host my lecture notes and tutorial problems for MATH3611 Higher Analysis in 2025T2 @ UNSW. In this iteration, the course was taught by Dr Denis Potapov.

Compiled pages are published at [https://jeremyle56.github.io/course-notes/math3611/](https://jeremyle56.github.io/course-notes/math3611/).

This course goes through the following topics:

1. [Cardinality](./course_notes/cardinality.md)
2. [Metric Spaces](./course_notes/metric_spaces.md)
3. [Sequences of Series and Functions](./course_notes/sequence_and_series_of_functions.md)
4. [Topological Spaces](./course_notes/topological_spaces.md)
5. [Compactness and Connectedness](./course_notes/compactness_and_connectedness.md)

There will no doubt be typos, errors and inaccuracies scattered throughout these notes as I am student learning the content for the first time. If you come across any of these, please feel free to reach out and correct me. You can do so by creating a [pull-request](https://github.com/jeremyle56/course-notes/pulls) or an [issue](https://github.com/jeremyle56/course-notes/issues) detailing the corrections. If in doubt --- look up a proper textbook (the recommended textbook for this course is Kolmogorov and Fomin's "Introductory Real Analysis").
